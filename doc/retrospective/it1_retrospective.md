## Things we did in iteration1
1. Setup entire backend on mongoDB along with corresponding APIs for creating Users, Tasks, Groups
2. Implemented frontend login without password so we could distinguish between users
3. When a new User logs in, the new User object will be created in MongoDB
4. When a new User creates a new task (with name, coins, description, time fields), the new Task object will be created in MongoDB
5. All Users, Task, Groups are connected together using ObjectIds generated by MongoDB, allowing us to retrieve and update everything
6. Users see a chatbox in their home page, which will be future updated into Group components with chat functionality
7. We created TaskCards that users will see on their home page

## Issues and Challenges we faced
While we accomplished all the things that were assigned to members 2 days before the due date, we didn't quite consider the extra time it would take for us to integrate everything together. We had hoped to present a perfectly functional frontend that would show all the task cards a user has. But due to time constraints, the final result was a little buggy. 

We also assigned tasks without a lot of detail initially, so it also took some more clarification along the way which slowed progress.

## How we're gonna improve
After talking to Lidia, we agreed that we would set an earlier soft deadline for everyone to finish ahead of time and then we would all have time to fix bugs and integrate all our parts. When assigning issues on github we also made sure to include more comments in detail so everyone had a clear idea of what they were expected to accomplish.
