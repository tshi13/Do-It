## Reflection
For iteration1 we were rushing to piece together all the individual parts before the deadline. For this iteration, we decided to set a soft deadline 3 days before the deadline so we would have time to fix bugs and make sure everything was working. This strategy turned out really well and we were able to complete everything 48 hours before the deadline which was a huge improvement for us. We will continue with this strategy in iteration3 and hopefully get our tasks done by Sunday night.
It is worth noting for this iteration3 we will look into 2 APIs for our chat and do so in 2 separate teams. We will spend 2 days on this and then find the best Chat API. After that, we will divide more specific tasks and get the chat to work by the end of the iteration!
