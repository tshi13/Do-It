#### Iteration 5 User Stories Completed

## Reflection

Our groups' goals this iteration were x, y, z.
We achieved all three goals. There were some difficulties in getting Facebook Login to work, but as described below, it eventually worked for most devices in most cases.

### Successes
Our team delivered all the user stories outlined above in both sections, the 'general' and the "(more specific)" section. Specifically, the team did a great job on DoIt Login, Google Login, Heroku deployment, cleaning up backend files, and updating the notification and gamification of users joining tasks and getting paid for completing tasks in groups.

### Challenges we encountered

### What we will do differently for Iteration 1 of the next software project we do
For Iteration 1 of the next software project we do, we plan to discuss what kinds of features we will add next, possibly related to further frontend improvement (i.e. updating the UI/UX appearance of the app).

If we use external APIs again, our team hopes to stick more with APIs that have good documentation for our tech stack so that they are easier to work with.

Finally, we are considering trying to stick to a better soft deadline again, especially to help with merging certain features (like Facebook Login this time) which took some time.
