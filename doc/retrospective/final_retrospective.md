## Reflection

Our groups' goals this iteration were to improve the frontend and UI interface of the DoIt app.
We achieved this goal, and our successes and challenges are below.

### Successes
Our team completed the above user stories.   Specifically, we focused on designed an appealing logo, landing page, and login page. Furthermore, we included buttons, personal tasks, a pie chart, and a slideshow to fill up some space on the home page, which also greatly contributed to the frontend design.

### Challenges we encountered
- We worked on the pie chart, and sometimes a message like "Negative values not allowed in pie chart" arose. Jonathan and Taiming fixed this issue. 
- Margins, spacing, and page height on the webpage were somewhat challenging to work with sometimes.
- Our group sometimes forgot to change the backend Axios base URL between localhost:5000 and https://backend-oose-doit.herokuapp.com. This caused some minor deployment issues from time to time.

### Reflection on the last five iterations as a whole

#### Revisiting our original project proposal (SRS Iteration 1), noting changes, and noting what we have and haven't delivered

Accomplished:

Didn't accomplish (modified our original plan along the way):

- .

#### Challenges we have had throughout the last five iterations


### What we will do differently for Iteration 1 of the next software project we do
For Iteration 1 of the next software project we do, we plan to discuss what kinds of features we will add next, possibly related to further frontend improvement (i.e. updating the UI/UX appearance of the app).

If we do frontend work again, it would be great to look into more external libraries to use, since this time our experience working with external libraries (CSS styling, pie charts, group slideshow, MUI task cards) turned out pretty well.

Finally, the strategy of using a soft deadline throughout iterations was really helpful. Whenever we used a soft deadline, our team finished individual parts early, allowing for ample time to combine together our individual files into a working version for the whole group.
