*Software Requirement Specification*


Problem Statement: 
People often feel unmotivated and discouraged to do tasks. The Dolt app will help people stay focused with their tasks and be present by connecting with your close friends. People are more motivated by losses rather then gains, so we want to motivate people by driving them with the loss and the gain of recognition on social platforms.


Potential Clients：
Anyone who needs help staying focused and beat their procrastination. 
People who want to acquire new skills/complete tasks that they have difficulty staying consistent with.


Proposed Solution: 
Through the betting system in Dolt, users need a certain amount of Dolt coin to play the game. Users keep track of each other by using social media post and something else. The user who fails to do their tasks will lose coins and the rest users will spilt the coins evenly.

Software Architecture & Technology Stack: 
It will be a web application, and we will use the software stack react, express, node.js and mongodb. Programming languages could be Javascript and Python.


Similar Apps:
Forest. Forest users can earn points and plant ta ree by not using their cell phones. If they use their cell phone during that period their tree will die. However, the app has lack of interaction with other users. For our app, users will feel more excited with the betting system.
