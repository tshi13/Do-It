# *Software Requirement Specification*

## Problem Statement: 
People often feel unmotivated and discouraged to do tasks. The Dolt app will help people stay focused with their tasks and be present by connecting with your close friends. People are more motivated by losses rather then gains, so we want to motivate people by introducing consequences. We also allow them to be motivated by recognition and followers across our social platform.

## Potential Clients：
- Anyone who needs help with staying focused and beating their procrastination. 
- People who want to acquire new skills/complete tasks/achieve consistency.

## Proposed Solution: 
Through the betting system in Dolt, users need a certain amount of Dolt coin to play the game. Users in a group will set tasks for themselves and other people will keep track of them by using public social media posts or private group posts. The user who fails to do their tasks will lose coins and the rest of the users will spilt the coins evenly. Successful users will 

This solution allows users to complete tasks under the supervision of others (and face possible consequences) while enjoying the fun of gaining community recognition and rewards when friends fail to do tasks.

## Software Architecture & Technology Stack: 
It will be a web application, and we will use the MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. Programming languages could be Javascript and Python.


## Similar Apps:
Forest. Forest users can earn points and plant a tree by not using their cell phones. If they use their cell phone during that period their tree will die. However, the app lacks interaction with other users and customizability. For our app, users will feel more excited with the "betting system" and be more engaged with the community.
