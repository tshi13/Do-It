<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

The Doit application is to help you stay focus and motivated on the important things in life. Whenever you want to stay focused or show off your accomplishments to your circle of friend, use doit and place a bet. Stay motivated daily and turn hard work into a handful of doit coins. In the future, we believe that the doit would be a popular productivity app that helps people beat their laziness and reach their goal in an interesting and pleasant way. 

Here's why:
* People often feel unmotivated and discouraged to do academic, professional, and personal tasks. :sad:
* There currently are only to-do list applications that allow you to list and plan the tasks that you need to complete. 
* The market is lacking a solution that focuses on actually pushing users to actually do the tasks!

Through the betting system in Dolt, users need a certain amount of Dolt coins to play the game. Users can set private tasks for themselves or set tasks for everyone in a group. For group tasks, other people will keep track of them by verifying their public social media posts or private group posts. The user who fails to do their tasks will lose coins and the rest of the users will spilt the coins evenly. Successful users will be able to help friends gain better habits, get tasks done, earn more coins along the way, and have the opportunity to upload content to the general public. In this way, people are more motivated by losses rather then gains, so we want to motivate people by introducing consequences. We also allow them to be motivated by recognition and followers across our social platform.

Types of Coins:
* Paid coins (Correspond to real money)
* Free coins (Earn through daily checkin)

Either coins work well in our betting system. The existence of free coins allows users to complete tasks under the supervision of others (and face possible consequences) while enjoying the fun of gaining community recognition and rewards when friends fail to do tasks.

## Iteration 1 

### Usage
1. Use the Register button to create a new account (password is optional, not implemented for this iteration yet)

5. Enter the fields for the task then click confirm (may have to double click)

### User Stories (original) Completed on Iteration 1
- As a user, I want to be able to create tasks for myself to complete  
- As a user, I want to be able to enter a certain number of coins to the pool with my friends when setting up a task  
- As a user, I want to be able to enter a due date or time for when the task is due so that I can be held accountable by others to complete tasks on time

### More specific User Stories Completed on Iteration 1
- As developers, we want to setup mongodb and backend express
- As a developer and as a user, I want to be able to differentiate users from each other so I know who has which tasks.
- As developers, we want to create mongoose Schema for Task
